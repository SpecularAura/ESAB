# Fronted and Backend template for authentication 
This repo contains frontend code in React + ChakraUI which provides the template for Registration, Login and Protected Routes which is fully complete basic form validation
It also contains the backend code written in express which implements Session Based Authentication and works nicely with the frontend with React
If you don't want to use React the template can be used without it and can be found at (Placeholder for link)
To find usage go to the README of the respective folders:
Frontend: (Placeholder link)
Backend: (Placeholder)

## NOTE:
The backend is inspired from the tutorial (Placeholder link) and most of the code is from there. Please do check it out if you want to understand how authentication works
