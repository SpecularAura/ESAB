# Frontend with Session Authentication
This is the fronted for the session authentication template made using React + ChakraUI    
The Register form also has validation and the Protected Routes are implemented too
## To Run the Frontend:
- Run `npm i` within the directory which contains this README i.e /your/path/to/repo/auth-frontend
## With Backend 
- You must build the project since I am not aware of a good way to write a proxy in Vite for develoopment purposes
- To build run the command `npm run build` in the command line
- This watches for any changes and runs a creates a production build in `dist/` folder

## Without Backend:
- Refer to the frontend branch ( Not Completed Yet: Needs removal of fetch requests )

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
